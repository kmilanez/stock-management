# Stock Api Challenge

Your team launched a new stock api and everyone is excited to start using it! Coming to the office the next day, your manager reported the following issues:

- - Wallet balance is incorrect when adding some stocks, if you add 2 B stocks, the balance in the wallet is 2, instead of 4.
- - Converter is wrongly adding a amount of 3 to the wallet when the stock is not on the list. It needs to be generic.
  - Bulk updates makes lookup to StockValues performance to downgrade considerably.
 
  # Tasks

  - Fix the issues reported by your manager
  - Make Stock converter generic of stock type
  - Propose a improvement in StockValues data structure to speed up lookups.
